Additionally, GitHub allows for websites to be hosted free of charge and has a very simple synchronization system with local machine files. </p>

  						First and foremost, a strong message has to be clearly deducible. The purpose has to be clear, and the home page should be simple and concise. This is important, as search engines will categorize the website based on information in the home page. Furthermore, navigation through the website should be easy, where the user can intuitively browse through without getting lost. The flow should be natural, and unnecessary sub-paging should be avoided. <br /><br>
              The bulk of the website is based on the content, and this is where the most time should be spent on. The content is what supplements and further enhances the core message of the website, hence error-free language should be used, and unnecessary content should be avoided. The content should make the reader further interested in your business/service, and want to read more about you. Key words related to the business should be effectively used within the content, to allow increased appearances on search engines (Search Engine Optimization). <br /><br>
              In the current age, social media is a crucial platform for most people. The website should incorporate this aspect as well, by linking to social media through “share with” links. Finally, it is key for the website to meet accessibility standards, which will be discussed in the accessibility tab.
  					</div>
  					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-profile-tab">
              Website accessibility describes the accessibility of a website for users with disabilities (permanent or temporary) such as, but not limited to, auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visually impaired people. In 1999, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) led the Web Accessibility Initiative which introduced a standard for website accessibility. A revised version was introduced in 2008, which was also implemented into the ISO standards. In addition to these guidelines, some individual governments have also introduced standards. The main points of considerations across all standards are illustrated below.<br /><br>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Providing alternatives:</strong></font><br /><br>
              Alternatives are often most useful for non-text objects such as images & videos (for the visually impaired, or for people with extremely slow internet speeds), and audio (for the speech impaired), or as labels for controls and functionality to allow for keyboard navigation and/or voice recognition-based navigation (for the neurologically impaired). This kind of accessibility is often achieved through directly writing appropriate HTML code. Some examples are illustrated below: <br /> <br>
              <ul>
                <li>	Using semantic HTML, such as using &lt;button&gt; instead of &lt;div&gt;  to correctly identify a button as a button. This allows for the button to be identifiable by a screen reader as a button, makes it clickable, and focusable. </li>
                <li> 	Using &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;… as heading definitions. This is important as search engines index the structure and content of the webpage based on headings. </li>
                <li>	Using the alt attribute to provide alternative information for multimedia. For example, an image of the earth could have an alt text of “Image of the earth”.</li>
                <li>	Declaring the correct language of the website in the form of &lt;html lang=”en”&gt;. This is important for search engines and screen readers to correctly read the content of the website.</li>
              </ul>
              In terms of multimedia, the following can be performed to make them accessible:<br /><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Create text transcripts to audio</li>
	              <li>Create audio descriptions to videos</li>
                <li>Sign-language interpretation of audio</li>
              </ul>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Presentation of content:</strong></font><br /><br>
              Making the content distinguishable makes it easier to read and hear when read aloud. Ways to achieve this include:<br /><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Making text resizable up to 200% in a standard browser</li>
	              <li>Making the video or audio on the website volume-adjustable, and possible to pause/stop</li>
	              <li>Images of text avoided as much as possible</li>
                <li>Do not use colour as the only way to emphasize text </li>
                <li>Do not use flashing content which can cause photosensitive reactions (or warn the user prior to presentation)</li>
                <li>Sufficient contrast is provided on the website</li>
              </ul>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Operable interface:</strong></font><br /><br>
              Some users rely solely on keyboard /mouse input due to neurological disabilities or other circumstances. Hence it is very important for the website to be navigable with only keyboard or mouse. Furthermore, it is important that the website is web and mobile friendly, with touch-screen compatibility. <br /><br>
              In this website in particular, special care has been made to include alt text for any images, and all of the content is accessible by mobile. Correct attributions were used in HTML where applicable, and all text is enlargeable.



  					</div>
  					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-contact" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-contact-tab">
              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was introduced in 2018 as a regulation in EU law on privacy and data protection. It is applicable to all organisations in the EU who process personal data, which includes collection, alteration, retrieval, storage, and destruction of personal data. <br /><br>
              In terms of websites, the simplest method of data collection is through cookies. Prior to the introduction of GDPR, cookies were often used to obtain web analytics and create custom website content for that individual, be it in the form of personalization of website content or tracking of web browsing habits. The use of cookies used to be opt-out based, however with GDPR, most reputable websites have implemented consent forms upon access. Furthermore, the vulnerability of children have been pointed out with GDPR, and some websites seek age-confirmation for agreeing to any personal-data consents. <br /><br>
              The scope of GDPR in websites does not only involve cookies, but essentially the entirety of personal data, which can be very significant in e-commerce, email subscription, and any form of data storage or processing.  In terms of implementation on this website, a pop-up banner has been implemented at the landing page to allow the user to opt-out of cookie usage (however the links are non-functional). Nevertheless, if a fully public website was to be created for an actual business, the following points can be considered to avoid breaching the GDPR.<br /><br>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>What can be done with personal data:</strong></font><br /><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Organise obtained personal data so that it is not lost in a swamp of data</li>
                <li>Make sure the obtained data is secure and not at risk from leaking</li>
                <li>Do not withhold personal data and information for no reason</li>
                <li>Have a process for providing information you have on a person, such that it can be retrieved upon request</li>
                <li>Have a process for deleting personal data if requested</li>
                <li>Allow people to positively opt-in for personal data to be used in marketing and business purposes, rather than opt-out</li>
                <li>Use layered opt-in forms and avoid bundling opt-ins</li>
                <li>Make it simple to opt-out, if someone wishes to do so</li>
              </ul>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>How can users be warned:</strong></font><br /><br>
              Write a clear fair-processing-notice in which jargon is avoided, and add further information in regard to personal data. When presenting the notice, the following points should be carefully considered:<br /><br>
              <ul>
                <li>What information is collected from the user?</li>
                <li>Who is collecting it? Clearly name any parties for which the consent is being granted</li>
                <li>How is personal data collected. Cookies? Manual input by user? etc. </li>
                <li>Why is personal data collected, and how will this data be used by the business?</li>
                <li>What will be the effect on the individual? Will he/she receive any emails? </li>
                <li>Is the user underaged? Is the personal information sensitive? Can it affect a child, and are there any counter measures to avoid this? (such as a tickbox for confirming age upon access)</li>

  					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-about" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-about-tab">
              As mentioned previously, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) would be an important step to increase search hits for the website. An easy way of SEO is using keywords which are often searched by the targeted market. This can be researched in the Google keyword tool, upon which the keywords can be implemented in the website to increase search hits.  SEO can be done through effective titles in the website which include keywords, within the &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;… attributes. <br /><br>

              A more direct way is to advertise the website on search engines such as Google with GoogleAdWords. In most cases, it works in a pay-per-click basis, where each click by a user on the ad has to be paid by the advertiser; hence the objective would be to convince that user to purchase the product/service, thereby creating a return in investment. Ads can also be placed on social media such as Facebook, or well-known sites such as YouTube, where the advertising target audience is strategically selected by the hosting site. <br /><br>

              Often users visit a website once and leave. Retargeting this audience is a key method to market the website. This is often achieved by placing a tracking cookie into the user when they first visit the website. Once the user leaves the website and starts browsing the internet, they will start seeing ads of the website they previously visited. As briefly discussed in the GDPR tab, this method can be very damaging to the business if it is not clearly declared and warned to the user.
  					</div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-further" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-further-tab">
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Improving the website:</strong></font><br /><br>
              There is significant room for improvement on the website. Currently the website lacks appropriate multimedia content to realistically visualise the product which we aim to produce. This can be improved through content such as better CAD renders, videos of the product in use, and specific data examples which can be obtained upon usage. Since this product is aimed at the scientific community, enough background based on publication and literature should be provided in order to justify the potential accuracy and precision of the product. In terms of website manoeuvrability, a significantly improved footer could be used, in which one could navigate through the website without having to go back up for the nav bar, and find contact information, too.  <br /><br>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Expanding into e-commerce:</strong></font><br /><br>
              If our product were to be brought into the market, there should be a methodology for users to obtain it through the internet. There are two main methods of selling online, either through pre-existing platforms such as Amazon, or through setting up a personal e-commerce website.  <br /><br>
              In case of creating an original e-commerce website, a suitable hosting platform has to be selected if not done so yet. Prior to actually selling the product, prices as well as shipping methods and costs have to be taken into consideration. In order to receive payments, one needs a merchant account, which is essentially a way to receive credit card payments for each purchase.  This can be done through big-name brands such as Chase or PayPal, or other smaller brands. A small fee is usually incurred for receiving any money for purchases, however the ease of use makes it a good option. Once this is ready, assuming the user selected PayPal as its merchant account, a PayPal integrated input form can be created on the website to accept payments. A clear infrastructure has to be ready to accept orders, process them, ship them, and keep the customer well-informed. <br /><br>
              More importantly, a SSL certificate should ideally be purchased. This is a certificate which essentially encrypts any sensitive information provided by the user to the website, so that it is not vulnerable. It is visible at the URL of a browser usually with a green font or background with the text https, and indicates the user that private information of any kind such as payment information and addresses are kept safe. <br /><br>
              <font size = "+2"><strong>Further expansions and investor relations:</strong></font><br /><br>
              If additional time were given, the privacy policy and personal data management details would be clearly stated within the website. Once sufficient research has been done, and the concept has been proven to work, the product can be advertised on crowdfunding websites such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter. However, since our product is not a consumer product, crowdfunding is most likely to fail. Alternatively, institutional or private investors can be directly obtained through reaching out to them through personal networking. In most cases, private investments have 3 stages (A round, B round and C round), and at each stage the company receives investments to scale up their business. Investments are usually in exchange of equity or partial ownership of the company.
